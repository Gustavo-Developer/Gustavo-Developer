Hi, call me Gustavo Mendes üëã. I'm a Software Engineer at Accenture üë®‚Äçüíª.
I'm specialized in delivering high-quality Full-Stack solutions 

As a Full Stack developer with experience in React, Angular and Node, I bring a diverse set of technical skills and hands-on experience to software development projects. I have a deep understanding of React and its component-based architecture, as well as Angular and its robust MVC framework. My Node experience includes building RESTful APIs and implementing authentication and authorization with JWT. In addition, I am able to work with different tools and technologies, such as Git, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, AWS, among others.

I am able to work both front-end and back-end, working closely with designers, product managers and development teams to build high-quality, scalable solutions. In addition, I possess excellent interpersonal and communication skills, which allow me to collaborate effectively with other team members and communicate clearly with stakeholders.

I'm always looking to learn and stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in software development and look forward to applying my experience and knowledge to new challenges.
